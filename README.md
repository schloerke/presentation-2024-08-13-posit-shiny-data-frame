# Data frames in Shiny for Python

## Abstract

Integrating editable data frames into Py-Shiny and Shinylive applications streamlines data scientists' workflows by allowing real-time data manipulation directly within interactive web applications. This new feature enables users to edit, copy, and paste cells within the data frame output, facilitating immediate analysis and visualization feedback. It simplifies the process of data exploration and hypothesis testing, as changes to the data set can be instantly reflected in the application's outputs without the requirement to update the original data, keeping data-scientists “scientists”, not data-_janitors_.
